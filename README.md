# Novexa: Industrial Intelligence & Strategy Platform

Novexa is a dual-engine platform designed to serve two distinct but interconnected markets: small brands seeking accessible business intelligence and large enterprises looking to solve complex R&D challenges. By integrating AI-powered analytics with a global crowdsourcing network, Novexa provides tools for both instant self-diagnosis and long-term strategic execution.

## Key Features

The platform is built on three core pillars:

### 1. ⚙️ Standard Analytics: The Instant Self-Diagnosis Layer

Designed for small brands and D2C businesses, the BI Platform provides a suite of AI-powered calculators to democratize complex analysis without needing a team of data scientists.

- **Profitability Diagnostics**: Instantly validate new product ventures with tools like the **Launch Planner (Break-even/ROI)** and **Unit Economics Simulator (CAC vs. LTV)**.
- **Operational Health Check**: Optimize cash flow and supply chain with the **Inventory Health** dashboard (identifying dead stock and turnover) and the **Supplier Scorecard** (quantifying reliability).
- **Customer & Market Sensing**: Synthesize qualitative feedback with quantitative results using the **Review Analyzer** and the **Sales Dashboard** to connect customer sentiment directly to financial performance.

### 2. 🤖 AI Hub: Your Virtual Workforce for Strategic Execution

For enterprises, the AI Hub offers a premium, proactive solution that replaces manual analysis with autonomous agents that deliver quantifiable outcomes.

- **The Trend Spotter**: Predicts market trends (e.g., colors, fabrics) 3 months in advance by scanning global social media and keyword data, enabling proactive demand forecasting.
- **Virtual Focus Group**: Simulates feedback from 100+ virtual personas (Students, Geeks, etc.) to test product ideas, drastically reducing R&D costs and time-to-market.
- **Supply Chain Sentinel**: Monitors global news and geopolitical events in real-time to issue warnings about potential disruptions like chip shortages or port strikes, helping secure pricing and avoid delays.

### 3. 🧪 Beta Labs: Open R&D and Ecosystem Building

Beta Labs is our forward-looking engine for open innovation, data acquisition, and talent engagement.

- **Ground Truth Projects**: A volunteer network that solves real-world data scarcity problems by crowdsourcing authentic, local market data (e.g., *Mandi Price Watch* for inflation tracking).
- **Solver Arena**: Structures complex enterprise R&D needs into high-stakes competitions. Global talent competes to build working prototypes for cash prizes and contracts, driving cost-effective and innovative solutions (e.g., *'Reduce Fabric Cutting Waste by 15%'*).

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
